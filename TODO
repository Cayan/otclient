handle corrupt errors in dat/spr

* framework
rework Settings/g_configs
platform cursor cache
replace onKey events with Hotkeys.bind

* ui
rework hover => onWidgetVisibilityChange onWidgetEnableChange onWidgetMove onAppear onDisappear
reset dragging widget on destruction/visibility change/enable change
cancel layout changes on non visible widgets (acts like it doesn't exist)
add more anchors warnings to make creation of OTUIs easier
review UI/style loader and make more error prone with more warnings
change Align/Anchors lua API from enum to text
review widgets rendering order, consider adding z-index
reapply anchor styles when adding new childs
style inheritance using a style translator
find a way to add new widgets without focusing them
make set of background/icon/image width alone work
make api to enable/disable capture of events like mouseMove to avoid massive event processing
move layout proprieties to widget style
terminate rework of ui events propagation  (for Key events)

* lua engine
make possible to bind non LuaObject derived classes on lua engine (for usage with Point,Rect,Color,Size)
review usage of x,y/width,height in lua instead of point/size
